# Superstore-Sales-Analysis
# **Introduction**
This project provides an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a Superstore sales dataset, uncovering trends in sales performance, customer behavior, and profitability. The analysis involves data cleaning, feature engineering, visualizations, and a basic linear regression model to predict profit based on sales features.

# **Project Overview**

  This analysis answers key business questions, including:

 - Which regions and states generate the most sales and profit?
 - What product categories and sub-categories perform best?
 - How do discounts impact profitability?
 - What customer segments are most valuable?

# **Dataset**
   The dataset includes sales transactions with columns like:
   Order Details (Order ID, Date, Ship Mode)
   Customer Information (Name, Segment, Location)
   Product Data (Category, Sub-Category, Sales, Discount, Profit)

# **Tools & Libraries Used**
 Python
 pandas – for data manipulation
 matplotlib & seaborn – for data visualization
 scikit-learn – for building a simple regression model

# **Analysis & Insights**
Sales Trends: Sales generally increase over time with monthly fluctuations.
Category Performance: Office Supplies have the highest sales, while Technology yields better profit margins.
Regional Profitability: The West region shows the highest profitability.
Discount Impact: Discounts negatively correlate with profit, suggesting over-discounting may hurt earnings.
Predicting Profit: A basic regression model indicates that sales and discounts moderately predict profitability.

# **Visualizations**
The project includes various insightful visualizations:
Sales trends over time
Sales by category & sub-category
Profit distribution across regions
Discount vs Profit analysis
Heatmap of profit by category & region

# **Conclusion**
 The Superstore Sales Analysis revealed insightful trends in sales, profit, and customer behavior. 
Key findings include:
 • Sales generally increase over time with noticeable monthly fluctuations.
 • Office Supplies contribute the highest sales, while Technology yields higher profit 
margins.
 • The West region shows the highest profitability.
 • Discounts negatively correlate with profit, suggesting over-discounting may harm 
profitability.
 • A basic regression model indicates that sales and discount can moderately predict profit, 
but more features and refined modeling may improve performance.
 This analysis can support strategic decisions in inventory management, pricing, and marketing.
